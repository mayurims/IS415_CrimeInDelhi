```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, kableExtra, tidyverse, sfdep, readxl, plyr, Kendall, plotly, dplyr)
```

```{r}
IPC <- read_xlsx("data/aspatial/1 Districtwise IPC Crimes_2021.xlsx")
#IPC_Original <- read_xlsx("data/aspatial/1 Districtwise IPC Crimes_2021.xlsx")
#glimpse(IPC_Original)
```

We remove the first 3 rows as they are just headings and have NA values. We will not be using them anyways.

```{r}
IPC <- IPC %>%
  slice(5:n())
```

Convert to numeric

```{r}
df <- IPC %>%
  select(-c("...1", "...2")) %>%
  mutate_if(is.character,as.numeric)
```

Group data to reduce cardinality

```{r}
temp_df <- df |> rowwise() |>
  summarise(murders = sum(`Murder (Sec.302 IPC)`,`Dowry Deaths (Sec.304-B IPC)`),
            attempted_muders = sum(`Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder (Sec.304 IPC)`,`Abetment of Suicide (Sec.305/306 IPC)`, `Attempt to Commit Murder (Sec.307 IPC)`, `Attempt to commit Culpable Homicide (Sec.308 IPC)`, `Attempt to Commit Suicide (Sec.309 IPC)`, `Miscarriage, Infanticide, Foeticide and Abandonment (Sec.313 to 318 IPC) \r\n`),
            death_negligence = sum(`Causing Death by Negligence`,`...6`,`...7`,`...8`,`...9`,`...10`,`...11`,`...12`),
            hurt = sum(`Hurt`,`Wrongful Restraint/Confinement (Sec.341 to 348 IPC)`),
            women_assault = sum(`Causing Death by Negligence`,`Assault on Women with Intent to Outrage her Modesty`),
            kidnapping_abduction = sum(`Kidnapping and Abduction`),
            human_exploitation = sum(`Human Trafficking (U/S 370)`, `Exploitation of Trafficked Person 370A IPC)`, `Selling of Minors for Prostitution (Sec.372 IPC)`, `Buying of Minors for Prostitution (Sec.373 IPC)`, `Rape (Sec.376 IPC)`, `Attempt to Commit Rape (Sec.376/511 IPC)`, `Unnatural Offences (Sec.377 IPC)`),
            state_offence = sum(`...64`),
            public_tranquility = sum(`Offences against Public Tranquillity (Total)`),
            movable_property = sum(`Offences against Property (Total)`),
            document_fraud = sum(`Offences Relating to Documents & Property Marks (Total)`),
            miscellaneous = sum(`Miscellaneous IPC Crimes(Total)`, `...143`))
```

Join into df

```{r}
df <- cbind(IPC$"...1", IPC$"...2", temp_df) %>%
       rename("State" = "IPC$...1",
              "District" = "IPC$...2")
```

```{r}
