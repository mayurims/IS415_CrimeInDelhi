```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, kableExtra, tidyverse, sfdep, readxl, plyr, Kendall, plotly, dplyr)
```

```{r}
IPC <- read_xlsx("data/aspatial/1 Districtwise IPC Crimes_2021.xlsx")
IPC_Original <- read_xlsx("data/aspatial/1 Districtwise IPC Crimes_2021.xlsx")
glimpse(IPC_Original)
```

We remove the first 3 rows as they are just headings and have NA values. We will not be using them anyways.

```{r}
IPC <- IPC %>%
  slice(5:n())
```

Since, there are many types of crime reported in the data, we will be categorizing them for better analysis.

```{r}
mydata_summed <- IPC %>%
  filter(...1 == "Andhra Pradesh") %>%
  rowwise()

mydata_summed1 <- mydata_summed %>%
  summarise(total = sum(as.numeric(...6) + as.numeric(...7)))

```
