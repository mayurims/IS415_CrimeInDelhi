Navigate to the EDA tab for the next section.

## EDA

This section contains interactive choropleth maps for the crimes.

-   Select the crimes under - Indian Penal Code or State and Local Laws

-   Select crimes - Choose your target variable of type of crime to view the choropleth mapping of

-   Select classification method - Choose type of classification style from the following - fixed, standard deviation, equal, pretty, quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, jenks

-   Select number of classes - Use the slider to select the number of classes for the classification method used.

-   Select colour scheme - Choose your favourite colour scheme from the given list.

Navigate to the Global Spatial Autocorrelation tab for the next section

## Global Spatial Autocorrelation

This section contains permutations and spatial lag for different types of spatial autocorrelation.

Similar to the first two points under the EDA section,

-   Select the crimes under - Indian Penal Code or State and Local Laws

-   Select crimes - Choose your target variable of type of crime to perform the test on

-   Select Spatial Autocorrelation test - Choose between Moran's I Test and Geary's C test

-   Map output - The first plot contains a historgram of the residuals of the permutations and the second plot contains the spatial lag variables of that test.

Navigate to the Cluster & Outlier & LISA Cluster Maps for the next section

## Cluster & Outlier & LISA Cluster Maps

This section contains visualisations for the local moran's I values and a local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) cluster maps.

Similar to the first two points under the EDA section,

-   Select the crimes under - Indian Penal Code or State and Local Laws

-   Select crimes - Choose your target variable of type of crime to visualise

-   Select visualising maps - Choose visualisation map between local moran's values and the lisa cluster map

-   Select variable - For local moran's values, choose the secondary map to view among the following list - local moran's I statistics, expectation, variance, standard deviation, p-value. For the lisa cluster maps, choose to view among the following list - Moran scatterplot, Moran scatterplot with standardised variables and lisa map classes (shows quadrant based values)

Navigate to the Hot&Cold Spot Analysis for the next section

## Hot&Cold Spot Analysis

Our final section contains a hotspot and coldspot analysis based on Getis-Ord Gi\* statistics.

Similar to the first two points under the EDA section,

-   Select the crimes under - Indian Penal Code or State and Local Laws

-   Select crimes - Choose your target variable of type of crime to visualise

-   Select distance weights matrix - Choose computation type of distance weights matrix between fixed and adaptive weights.
