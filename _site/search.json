    "text": "Background\nIndia has a high rate of crime. Crime rates in India can vary depending on the region, with certain areas experiencing higher rates of crime than others. For example, tourist destinations such as Delhi, Goa, and Mumbai are known to have higher rates of petty crime, such as pick pocketing and theft, especially in crowded areas like markets and train stations. However, violent crime against tourists is rare in India.\n\n\nProject Motivation\nIndia is known for its rich cultural and historical heritage, various kinds of ecology, places of natural beauty, heart touching ancient and much more are spread across the country. There are definitely enough attractive destinations for overseas tourists. However, with the high crime rate in India, it will discouraged tourist from visiting India and appreciate its unique culture.\nTherefore, we hope that creating this application can bring benefits to multiple stakeholders: by helping policymakers understand the nature and extent of crime rate in the different districts of India so that they could work on investigation and enforce stricter law in the identified high crime districts. Additionally, it aims to also help to raise public awareness about crime and safety issues, tourists can make more informed choices to where they want to go after knowing the crime rates in different districts in India.\n\n\nProject Objectives\nOur research would focus on conducting a geospatial analysis of crime patterns in India by identifying the crime rates in the different districts of India. Additionally, we will also be analysing the types of crimes and offenders in each district, with the aim of aiding crime prevention and law enforcement efforts.\n\n\nDatasets\nGeospatial Data\n\nGIS Data: This contains the shp file of the boundaries of India.\n\nAspatial Data\n\nDistrictwise IPC Crimes 2021: The dataset consists of crimes punishable under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on a district level including the 28 states and 8 union territories. There are 142 such crimes that can be further combined.\nDistrictwise SLL Crimes 2021: Similarly, this dataset consists of crimes punishable under Special and Local Laws (SLL) on a district level including the 28 states and union territories. There are 92 such crimes that can be further combined.\n\nData Preparation\n\n\nLiterature Review\n\n\nMethodology\nFor our project, we will be using a collection of geospatial statistical for measuring global and local spatial analysis of crime in the districts of India.

Rao, Mayur Raj and P. Alok Verma\n\nObjective\nIdentify crime prone zones through crime mapping with probability of occurrence based on the past incidence of various crime locations\nMethodology\n\nEuclidean distances of Crimes from Police station and Highways\nCluster Analysis\nHotspot Analysis\nInterpolation (co-Kriging) : To predict the susceptible crime regions based on the correlation with other non-spatial attributes\n\nLearning Points\n\nThe use of co-Kriging total crime with socioeconomic factors as an estimation method\nThe use of weighted overlay analysis of selected variables to predict crime prone areas\n\nAreas of Improvement\n\nLocal Gi* statistics could have been used to better filter the data based on crime levels\nEuclidean distance mapping was unnecessary. Alternates like scatter plots with regression lines could have been used to visualise the distance better.\nThe correlation coefficients for co-Krining were really high (0.9+) and could have caused high collinearity.\n\n\nAnalysis of Criminal Spatial Events in GIS for predicting hotspots\nBy Abbas F. Mohammed and Wadhah R. Baiee\n\nObjective\nTo recognize the hotspots for crime data like Shooting, Homicide and Assault by threat in Baltimore, Maryland\nMethodology\n\nGetis-Ord Gi* statistics\nHot Spot Analysis\n\nLearning Points\n\nThe use of a small dataset and region was beneficial to get a granular understanding of the crimes rates over time\n\nAreas of Improvement\n\nThere could have been a final aggregation of the crimes as a final visualisation.\nAdditional data on the strength of each police district could have improved the predictive value of crime rates\n\nThe Mann-Kendall Test could have been incorporated for each police district to better gauge its crime rate over the given time period\n\nGIS Technologies in Crime Analysis and Crime Mapping\nBy Vijaya Kumar and C. Chandreasekar\n\nObjective\nIdentify relationship between financial characteristics and crime rate in Chennai and use it to explore other incident sites.\nMethodology\n\nGIS Event Analysis\nTemporal and Spatial Distribution of Incidents\nDensity Analysis by Kernel Estimation\nHot Spot Analysis\n\nLearning Points\n\nThe linking of geographic factors (such as land use) to type of crime was an interesting way to generate crime predictions.\nHotspot Analysis can be done by Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Crime (STAC) program\n\nAreas of Improvement\n\nThe hotspot analysis could have been segregated by incident type to generate better insights from the data.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nFor our project, we will be using a collection of geospatial statistical for measuring global and local spatial analysis of crime in the districts of India.
